# Traffic-Violation-Based-on-Lane-and-Speed

The aim of this project is to detect and track lane violations by heavy vehicles on the roads. 
In order for a lane violation to be considered as a lane violation, the speed of the vehicle 
in front of it and whether a vehicle is coming from behind are taken into consideration.
